# IoT Based Early Flood Detection and Avoidance

## Main objective
The main objective of this project is to build a simple IoT based system to detect the possibility of flood in
its early stage by monitoring the conditions at the place so that necessary precautions can be taken.

## Implemented Attributes
* NodeMCU and Arduino as microprocessors
* DHT11 sensor to get the values of temperature and humidity.
* Water Level sensor and water flow sensor, using which we can develop a rough profile of the situation
of water at that location.
* LCD display to display which locations are safe.
* Used ThingSpeak cloud platform to display the readings for monitoring.
* Used Twilio as a cloud service to send SMS.
